We are not your kind of people
You seem kind of phoney
Everything's a lie
We are not your kind of people
Something in your makeup
Don't see eye to eye
We are not your kind of people
Don't want to be like you
ever in our lives
We are not your kind of people
We fight when you start talking
There's nothing but white noise
Running around trying to fit in,
wanting to be loved
It doesn't take much for someone
to shut you down
When you build a shell,
build an army in your mind
You can't sit still and
you don't like hanging round
the crowd
They don't understand
You dropped by as I was sleeping
You came to see the whole
commotion
And when I woke I started
laughing
The jokes on me for not
believing
We are not your kind of people
Speak a different language
We see through your lies
We are not your kind of people
Won't be cast as demons,
creatures you despise
We are
extraordinary people
We are
extraordinary people
We are
extraordinary people
We are
extraordinary people

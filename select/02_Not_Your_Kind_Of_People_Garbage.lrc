[00:17.98] We are not your kind of people
[00:23.92] You seem kind of phony
[00:27.82] Everything's a lie
[00:33.88] We are not your kind of people
[00:39.79] Something in your makeup
[00:43.70] Don't see eye to eye
[00:49.70] We are not your kind of people
[00:55.36] Don't want to be like you
[00:59.53] Ever in our lives
[01:05.46] We are not your kind of people
[01:10.82] We find when you start talking
[01:14.55] There's nothing but white noise
[01:30.05] 
[01:21.45] Aaahh aahh aaahhh aahh
[01:36.98] Aaahh aahh aaahhh aahh
[01:47.98] 
[02:23.87] Running around trying to fit in
[02:27.16] Wanting to be loved
[02:30.78] It doesn't take much
[02:34.56] For someone to shut you down
[02:39.02] When you built a shell
[02:41.01] Built an army on your mind
[02:43.25] You can't sit still
[02:45.04] And you don't like hanging round the crowd
[02:50.28] They don't understand
[03:00.78] 
[02:56.25] You dropped by as I was sleeping
[03:03.39] You came by to see the whole commotion
[03:10.92] And when I woke, I started laughing
[03:18.38] The joke's on me for not believing
[03:35.38] 
[03:25.93] We are not your kind of people
[03:31.68] Speak a different language
[03:35.55] We see through your lies
[03:41.33] We are not your kind of people
[03:47.27] Won't be cast as demons
[03:51.17] Creatures you despise
[04:01.67] 
[03:57.25] We are extraordinary people
[04:03.76] We are extraordinary people
[04:11.56] We are extraordinary people
[04:19.35] We are extraordinary people
